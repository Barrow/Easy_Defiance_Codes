Update notes:

Version 0.0.0.1
	* Initial release
	
=======================================================================

This code is being released under the GPL. I'd appreciate it if you let me know if you use this code for another project, because I'd be interested in checking it out.

Generic disclaimer: If the program doesn't work, kicks your dog, sends covert hit squads after your mother, or otherwise does anything you think is bad, I'm not responsible. I'm happy to help and implement suggestions, but at the end of the day the source-code is included and I am only providing you with this script with the hope it will make your life easier; I hold no liability toward its usage nor results.

Thanks, and enjoy.
